In this homework, you will practice using Flexbox properties.

Follow the instructions to submit the homework:

- If you haven't forked the repository yet:
  Fork this repository and clone it on your local machine, then follow the steps below.
   
- If you already have the forked repository:
Sync the repository if there are changes in the upstream, then follow the steps below.


1. Make sure you are in the *flexbox* folder
2. Create a new branch 
3. Switch to the new branch 
4. Create another folder inside the *flexbox* folder with your GitHub username or regular name
5. Copy the index.html file and the styles.css file to your newly created folder
6. Open the copied html file inside your browser (you can use the Live Server extension from VSCode)
7. Examine the HTML code and after that go to the styles.css file and solve the exercises (you have to align the items as in the image below)

**Exercise 1:**
- the flex items have to fill up the whole available space in the flex container

**Exercise 2:**
- the first flex item should grow twice the amount as the other flex items

**Exercise 3:**
- the flex items should be aligned vertically on the bottom of the flex container and have a 5px space between them

**Exercise 4:**
- the second flex item should have a width of 200px and should not grow or shrink

**Exercise 5:**
- the flex items should have a width of 200px and they should not grow to fill up the available space but they should wrap when the flex container is shrinking

8. Add the modified folder/files to the next stage 
9. Make a commit
10. Push the changes to your fork 
11. Create a pull request
12. Wait for the feedback
